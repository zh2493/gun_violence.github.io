## The tentative project title
Relationship between gun crime rate and Covid-19 outbreak in US

## The motivation for this project
- 2020 is an unusual and turbulent year during which the world has struggled with a pandemic for a long time. Since January 15 2020 in which  the first case of Covid-19 appeared in the United States, the epidemic has lasted 22 months and when it will end still remains uncertain. Under the influence of it, peopleâ€™s lifestyle, mental health and some economic indicators like GDP, unemployment rate fluctuate dramatically in America.\
- In the meantime, 2020 was a record year for gun violence during which there was a huge increase in gun deaths compared with previous years, and 2021 is trending even higher. Many factors could be playing a role in the rise in gun violence,including the unprecedented surge in gun sales, hampered anti-crime efforts,racial strife spurred by the murder of George Floyd last year as well as pandemic.\
- On November 9, a heartbreaking news was reported that a 24-year-old graduate Chinese student was shot and killed in Chicago. Some still remembered another tragic news that Yiran Fan,a 30-year-old University of Chicago PH.D. student from Beijing, who was killed in January 2021 in a mass shooting. The victims of  these two accidents are  both Chinese students and murdered by gun. This brutal incident was reported on all social platforms and set us thinking deeply. As a team of Chinese, we feel griefful for ourour grief over compatriotsâ€™ death  andmotivates us to investigate question  the safety issues of studying in the U.S. \
- Under this circumstance,our group members are inspired to study gun violence and explore the relationship between gun crime rate and Covid-19 outbreak. We hypothesize that the rise of gun crime has a connection  with the outbreak of Covid-19 and we propose a  further conjecture that deterioration of mental health and decline of unemployment rate are two of  factors which impact the increasing gun violence during epidemic. 

## The intended final products
- Our intended final products include a report regarding the association between gun crime rate and the Covid-19 outbreak in  U.S, a discussion about the possible contributors underlying this association (mental health status, unemployment rate, etc.), and heat maps for covid cases, mental health status, unemployment rate, and crime rate across different states in the US.\
- At the same time, we also plan to study the changes in the number of gun crimes in different areas under the influence of Covid-19 and explore the reasons for these different changes, especially in different areas of New York.

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
Visualize the trend in covid cases and mental health status(maybe with anxiety and depression symptoms) and analyze whether the changes in covid cases would have any influence on the survey results of mental health.\ We may also create a heat map for covid cases, mental health, and gun violence to provide the audience with a general idea of their prevalence.

## The planned timeline
```{r, message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
date = c("Nov. 20", "Nov. 20-Dec. 2", "Dec. 2-Dec. 10", "Dec. 11-Dec. 15")
task = c("Decide the project description", "Visualize the data and analysis their association and create a heatmap", "Optimize the plot and the webpage and make an explanatory video", "Make brief assessment and prepare discussion")
timeline = tibble(date, task)
head(timeline) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
